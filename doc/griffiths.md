Interconnectedness: 

There are several measures defined here.
Clustering coefficient describes the interconnectedness of content  -- Watts & Strogatz, 1998

I mean the question is similarity vs associatedness

Good history: Hobbes 
Word association norms published

Collins & Loftus, 1975 -- from cognitive psychology, however, these feature
different types of edge connector

vs a space representation: we previously discussed clustering in space.

Steyvers and Tenenbaum 2005 -- constructed semantic networks from word association
and perform analysis on them.

It's called a frame network.  Loftus and COllins did plenty of work on this stuff.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network

We go back to the cognitive psychology literature
