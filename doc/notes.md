So we need some way to produce an Importable / Exportable Set

This is tricky

The Importable Set needs to be produced first.

It's obvious that

killbox for each level

Plus should only appear on the final (lowest) taxonomy level and should be greyed
out if there are no taxonomy levels remaining
Kill button top left

Shade
Plus button forms the last pulse and pulses remain below

Adding 'floating' widget with plus button causes it to be untagged and shown
with border.  Can be moved into a category of taxonomical types.  Then it 
merges into a compound widget.

Grabbing entire groups and dropping and rearranging them: This means grabbing by
taxonomy type.

Also dragging should be restricted to within a certain vertical range.

Widget birth spec: One row representing the taxonomy type
One row representing the level
A series of 'pulses' -- icons for these?
A button on the widget itself that adds a new widget IN THAT TAXONOMY TYPE

All widgets for a given taxonomy type are grouped, with a certain bracket
When one widget is dragged onto another widget, the top first level widget
'absorbs' the lower level widget
The filter-meaning is absorbed into it and the glyph disappears.
When I want to edit, I toggle a particular level by clicking the level-indicator
This will pop-out the other levels, shunting other type-brackets down the line
(Other ones that are shunted down the line will just occlude off the screen)

The blank widget button still exists

Speccing for next sprint:

Having done the proof of concept for the taxonomy export root finder.  The next
step is to actually find out how to export the taxonomy.  Only then can the widgets
load it.




When we need to mock out the interface, we need to use MagicMock to mock the session

    mock_driver = unittest.mock.Mock()
    mock_session = unittest.mock.MagicMock()
    mock_driver.session.return_value = mock_session
    mock_session.__enter__ = lambda self: self
    mock_session.run.return_value = 42

First goal: Export taxonomy
Problem: Need to specify taxonomy root in order to export a tree.
Question: How to specify taxonomy root?
Attempt: Specify by string name.
Problem: Does not uniquely identify node.
Question: How to uniquely identify node?
 {
   Attempt: Use UUID.
   Problem: Makes it hard to test.
   Answer: Mock UUID generator.
   Problem: Makes it hard for user to specify taxonomy.
   Answer: ??? Entails same code as below solution
  }
  {
  Attempt: find all valid roots at runtime and match string
  Problem: can we enforce at database level?  would entail in-degree constraints
  Answer: Use constraint?
  }
}

When we parse taxonomies, we should make sure that we aren't using 

The outcome of this was that  GATE support ontology import in the format OWL-lite.
It supports exporting either in GATE format which is a proprietary set of nodes:

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
    <GateDocument version="3">
    <!-- The document's features-->

    <GateDocumentFeatures>
    <Feature>

      <Value className="java.lang.String">created from String</Value>
    </Feature>
    </GateDocumentFeatures>
    <!-- The document content area with serialized nodes -->

    <TextWithNodes>The <Node id="4"/>wildehaard<Node id="14"/> did a blunderbaard on the <Node id="41"/>PDP-11.<Node id="48"/></TextWithNodes>
    <!-- The default annotation set -->

    <AnnotationSet>
    </AnnotationSet>

    <!-- Named annotation set -->

    <AnnotationSet Name="dave">
    <Annotation Id="0" Type="Mention" StartNode="4" EndNode="14">
    <Feature>
      <Name className="java.lang.String">class</Name>
      <Value className="java.lang.String">http://gate.ac.uk/owlim#animal</Value>
    </Feature>
    <Feature>
      <Name className="java.lang.String">ontology</Name>
      <Value className="java.lang.String">http://gate.ac.uk/owlim</Value>
    </Feature>
    </Annotation>
    <Annotation Id="1" Type="Mention" StartNode="41" EndNode="48">
    <Feature>
      <Name className="java.lang.String">class</Name>
      <Value className="java.lang.String">http://gate.ac.uk/owlim#computer</Value>

      <Name className="java.lang.String">ontology</Name>
      <Value className="java.lang.String">http://gate.ac.uk/owlim</Value>
    </Feature>
    </Annotation>
    </AnnotationSet>

    </GateDocument>

Or it supports exporting in an inline-annotation format which depends upon
defining the Annotation Set.

    first_idx = 0
    last_idx = len(phrase) - 1
    
    for index in range(last_idx):

        cypher_params = {
            'statement': "CREATE (t:Taxon $properties)",
            'parameters': None,
            'kwparameters': {
                'properties': {
                    'content': taxonomy_data['id']

        self.repository.run_statement(cypher_params)





Now that we own the N4J interface, we need to be able to declare what database
structure we want to get after the import happens, but in order to do that
we need to be extracting the graph labels as well as the properties.

The tarfile doesn't open successfully, so maybe it didn't download the first time

* Modify node
* Extract label from node

A node can have multiple labels; but perhaps we just don't support that use-case

So whatt about 'prepared statements'



























2018-11-07


We have an issue because we don't 'own' the n4j interface.  It's difficult to
mock out comfortably because our backend class calls things on it directly.
It returns objects that are not "plain old objects" essentially.  We'll have
to add a translation layer to convert it to our own objects.

We need two classes, Node and Relationship, to fully reconstruct the tree.

Node needs two methods:
   get_id() => int
   get_properties() => dict

Relationship needs four methods:
   get_start_node() => int
   get_end_node() => int
   get_properties() => dict
   get_type() => str

pull_graph now returns a dict where the values are lists of Nodes and
Relationships.

"Protocol family unavailable" on travis -- 

I ran into this in the process of setting up travis-ci; within its environments,
ipv6 :: is resolved, but cannot be bound. Fixed by 36c77dd.

Need to re-derive the integration test base case and reform it as neo4j.
